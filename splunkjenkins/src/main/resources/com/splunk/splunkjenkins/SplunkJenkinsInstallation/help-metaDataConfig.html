    #index
    index=main #this is global level
    console_log.index=ci_log #only for console_log
    #source
    source=sandbox
    console_log.source=jenkins_job
    #sourcetype
    sourcetype=_json
    #host
    host=sandbox
    </pre>
    will set index as ci_log for console_log event, main as index for others. jenkins_job as source for console_log
    event,
    sandbox as source for others
